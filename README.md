#What is Instagram?

Capture and Share the World's Moments
Instagram is a free and simple way to share your life and keep up with other people.

Take a picture or video, then customize it with filters and creative tools. Post it on Instagram and share instantly on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more—or send it directly as a private message. Find people to follow based on things you’re into, and be part of an inspirational community.
